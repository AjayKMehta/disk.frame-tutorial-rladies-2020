## What is {disk.frame}

Let's look at the [useR! 2019 presentation](https://www.beautiful.ai/-LgwO_sf5qrBouC0H0sG/1)

Let us go through the common questions on https://diskframe.com

## What you need to get started - Setting up

### Installation

Simply run

```r
install.packages("disk.frame")

# install the dataset package we will use in today's tutorial
install.packages("nycflights13")
```

### Recommended boilerplate

Running `setup_disk.frame()` immediately after `library(disk.frame)` is highly recommended. It starts up multiple R sessions and `{disk.frame}` will use those R sessions to parallel the workloads.

```
# this willl set disk.frame with multiple workers
setup_disk.frame()
```

*Note* by default it still start as many session as there are cores. So only servers with many many cores, this may not be a good idea. Hence you may control the number of sessions by setting `workers=`.

```
# this willl set disk.frame with multiple workers
setup_disk.frame(workers = 4) # set up 4 session
```
